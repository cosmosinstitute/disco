    <h1>CHAR MINAR</h1>
    <img src="images.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Charminar is a historic monument located in the heart of the city of Hyderabad, India. Built in 1591 by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, it stands as an iconic symbol of Hyderabad's rich history and heritage.

        The name "Charminar" translates to "Four Towers" or "Mosque of the Four Minarets" in Urdu and Persian. The monument is so named because of its four grand arches, each crowned by a minaret, which give it a distinctive and imposing appearance.
        
        Charminar was constructed to commemorate the end of a deadly plague that had ravaged the city. It served as a ceremonial gateway to the bustling markets of Hyderabad and also housed a mosque on its top floor, where prayers were offered by the Sultan and his followers.
        
        Today, Charminar remains a popular tourist attraction and a symbol of Hyderabad's vibrant culture and architectural grandeur. It stands amidst the bustling streets of the old city, surrounded by vibrant markets, bustling bazaars, and the lively atmosphere of daily life in Hyderabad.</p>
