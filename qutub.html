    <h1>QUTUB MINAR</h1>
    <img src="download.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Qutub Minar, located in Delhi, India, is one of the most iconic and tallest minarets in the world. It stands as a testament to the rich history and architectural prowess of India. Construction of the minaret was initiated by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, in 1192, and it was completed by his successors.

        The Qutub Minar is made primarily of red sandstone and marble and is adorned with intricate carvings and verses from the Quran. Rising to a height of 73 meters (239 feet), it consists of five distinct stories, each marked by a projecting balcony.
        
        The construction of Qutub Minar marked the beginning of Islamic rule in India, and it served various purposes over the centuries, including being a symbol of victory, a place for calling the faithful to prayer, and a watchtower to guard against invaders.
        
        Surrounding the Qutub Minar is the Qutub Complex, which includes several other historically significant structures, such as the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, the Alai Darwaza, the Iron Pillar of Delhi, and the Tomb of Iltutmish.
        
        The Qutub Minar and its surrounding complex were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993, recognizing their cultural and historical significance not only for India but for the world as a whole. Today, the site continues to attract visitors from around the globe, offering a glimpse into India's rich past and architectural marvels.</p>
